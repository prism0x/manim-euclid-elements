  "prose": "Let {ABC polygon} be a right-angled triangle having the right-angle {BAC angle}.\nI say that the square on {BC line} is equal to the (sum of the) squares on {BA line} and {AC line}.\n\nFor let the square {BDEC polygon} have been described on {BC line}, and (the squares) {GB polygon} and {HC polygon} on {AB line} and {AC line} (respectively) [Prop. 1.46].\nAnd let {AL line} have been drawn through point {A point}, parallel to either of {BD line} or {CE line} [Prop. 1.31].\nAnd let {AD line} and {FC line} have been joined.\nAnd since angles {BAC angle} and {BAG angle} are each right-angles, then two straight-lines {AC line} and {AG line}, not lying on the same side, make the (sum of the) adjacent angles equal to two right-angles at the same point {A point} on some straight-line {BA line}.\nThus, {CA line} is straight-on to {AG line} [Prop. 1.14].\nSo, for the same (reasons), {BA line} is also straight-on to {AH line}.\nAnd since angle {DBC angle} is equal to {FBA angle}, for (they are) both right-angles, let {ABC angle} have been added to both.\nThus, the whole (angle) {DBA angle} is equal to the whole (angle) {FBC angle}.\nAnd since {DB line} is equal to {BC line}, and {FB line} to {BA line}, the two (straight-lines) {DB line}, {BA line} are equal to the two (straight-lines) {CB line}, {BF line}, respectively.\nAnd angle {DBA angle} (is) equal to angle {FBC angle}.\nThus, the base {AD line} [is] equal to the base {FC line}, and the triangle {ABD polygon} is equal to the triangle {FBC polygon} [Prop. 1.4].\nAnd parallelogram {BL polygon} [is] double (the area) of triangle {ABD polygon}.\nFor they have the same base, {BD line}, and are between the same parallels, {BD line} and {AL line} [Prop. 1.41].\nAnd square {GB polygon} is double (the area) of triangle {FBC polygon}.\nFor again they have the same base, {FB line}, and are between the same parallels, {FB line} and {GC line} [Prop. 1.41].\nThus, the parallelogram {BL polygon} is also equal to the square {GB polygon}.\nSo, similarly, {AE line} and {BK line} being joined, the parallelogram {CL polygon} can be shown (to be) equal to the square {HC polygon}.\nThus, the whole square {BDEC polygon} is equal to the (sum of the) two squares {GB polygon} and {HC polygon}.\nAnd the square {BDEC polygon} is described on {BC line}, and the (squares) {GB polygon} and {HC polygon} on {BA line} and {AC line} (respectively).\nThus, the square on the side {BC line} is equal to the (sum of the) squares on the sides {BA line} and {AC line}.\n\nThus, in a right-angled triangle, the square on the side subtending the right-angle is equal to the (sum of the) squares on the sides surrounding the right-[angle].\n(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.\n",
